0,"Sure! Here is a JavaScript function that checks if a number is a perfect number:"
0,"```javascript"
1,"function isPerfectNumber(num) {"
1,"  let sum = 0;"
1,"  for (let i = 1; i < num; i++) {"
1,"    if (num % i === 0) {"
1,"      sum += i;"
1,"    }"
1,"  }"
1,"  return sum === num;"
1,"}"
1,"// Test the function"
1,"console.log(isPerfectNumber(28)); // Should return true (28 is a perfect number)"
1,"console.log(isPerfectNumber(12)); // Should return false (12 is not a perfect number)"
0,"```"
0,"In this code snippet, the `isPerfectNumber` function takes a number as input and checks if it is a perfect number by summing up all its factors (excluding the number itself) and comparing it with the original number. The function then returns `true` if the sum is equal to the original number, indicating that it is a perfect number, and `false` otherwise."
0,"The test cases using `console.log` statements at the end of the code demonstrate the functionality of the `isPerfectNumber` function."
0,"Sure! Here is a JavaScript function that checks if a number is a deficient number:"
0,"```javascript"
1,"function isDeficientNumber(num) {"
1,"  let sum = 0;"
1,"  for (let i = 1; i < num; i++) {"
1,"    if (num % i === 0) {"
1,"      sum += i;"
1,"    }"
1,"  }"
1,"  return sum < num;"
1,"}"
1,"// Test the function"
1,"console.log(isDeficientNumber(8)); // Output: true (8 is a deficient number)"
1,"console.log(isDeficientNumber(12)); // Output: false (12 is not a deficient number)"
0,"```"
0,"In this function, we calculate the sum of all the divisors of the input number excluding the number itself. If the sum is less than the input number, then the input number is a deficient number. The test cases using `console.log` statements demonstrate this functionality."
0,"Here is a JavaScript function that checks if a number is an abundant number:"
0,"```javascript"
1,"function isAbundantNumber(num) {"
1,"  let sum = 0;"
1,"  for (let i = 1; i <= num / 2; i++) {"
1,"    if (num % i === 0) {"
1,"      sum += i;"
1,"    }"
1,"  }"
1,"  return sum > num;"
1,"}"
1,"// Test the function"
1,"console.log(isAbundantNumber(12)); // Output: true (12 is an abundant number)"
1,"console.log(isAbundantNumber(28)); // Output: true (28 is an abundant number)"
1,"console.log(isAbundantNumber(8)); // Output: false (8 is not an abundant number)"
0,"```"
0,"You can copy and paste this code into a JavaScript file or a JavaScript console to test the `isAbundantNumber` function. This function calculates the sum of all divisors of a number (excluding the number itself) and returns true if the sum is greater than the number, indicating that the number is abundant."
